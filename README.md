# maxmcc.com

This is my website.

## How do I use it?

It’s hosted at [maxmcc.com](https://maxmcc.com), so go look at it there.

If you want to run it on your computer, I guess that’s fine by me, but you do not have my permission
to republish any of the website’s content without attribution. Most of the source code in this
repository is from the default template provided by the [Bridgetown static site
generator](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), and so you may have more success following their
instructions.

If that hasn’t dissuaded you (or if you are me from the future and have forgotten how this works),
run the following commands in a terminal:

```sh
gem install bridgetown -N
git clone https://github.com/maxmcc/maxmcc.github.io.git
cd maxmcc.github.io
bundle install && yarn install
bin/bridgetown start
```
