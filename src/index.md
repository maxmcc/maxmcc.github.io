I’m a software designer and developer. I currently work at Apple on interface and interaction
prototyping for future computing products. You can learn more about [prototyping at Apple][paa] in
this interview with a former colleague.

Much of my work isn’t yet public &mdash; or maybe never will be: somebody has to work on the
[thousand no’s for every yes][tnfey]. Among products Apple _has_ shipped, I’ve contributed to
interaction prototypes for [AirTag] in the FindMy app, [gestures on Apple Pencil][pencil], and the
iPhone 16 [Camera Control][cc].

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Arts in [cognitive
science][cogsci] and a Bachelor of Applied Science in [computer and information science][cis].
