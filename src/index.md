# Max McCarthy
{: .text-base }

I’m a software designer and developer who thinks we deserve better from our computers. I strive to
build systems that respect human attention and agency, and that make computing more useable for
everybody.

I currently work at Apple, helping to assess the potential of novel input technologies and
interaction models. I come up with ideas for new user interfaces and develop interactive prototypes
to try them out. Throughout the design process, I evaluate my work against high standards for ease
of use, logical consistency, and accessibility.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2016, with a Bachelor of Arts in [cognitive
science](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/cogsci/program/) and a Bachelor of Applied Science in [computer
and information science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu). At Penn, I served as head teaching assistant
for [CIS 120](https://seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/), a rigorous introduction to functional
programming and program design. I also helped found [Hack4Impact](https://hack4impact.org/), a
student group and 501&#8288;(c)&#8288;(3) that designs and builds software for nonprofit
organizations.
