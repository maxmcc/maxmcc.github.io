Pay transparency is an important tool for addressing inequality, especially in the technology
sector. I’m sharing some details of my compensation in the hope that I can help.

Fine, yes, I’ll put the exciting part first, but I hope you will keep reading after this. I joined Apple
full-time in August 2016. Here’s what my salary and total income were at the end of each calendar
year:

| End of | Level | Base salary | W-2 gross | W-2 post tax |
| :--- | :---- | ----------: | --------: | -----------: |
| 2016 | ICT2  |    $110,000 |           |              |
| 2017 | ICT3  |    $130,000 |  $159,800 |     $104,300 |
| 2018 | ICT3  |    $134,600 |  $211,800 |     $146,000 |
| 2019 | ICT3  |    $139,600 |  $259,600 |     $178,200 |
| 2020 | ICT3  |    $150,600 |  $385,700 |     $261,900 |
| 2021 | ICT4  |    $183,000 |  $472,300 |     $284,700 |

    font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}
</style>

The base salary is not particularly important. The entire W-2 income includes grants of restricted
stock units (RSUs) and discounts on Apple stock purchased through the employee stock purchase plan
(ESPP).

```swift
func foo(x: Int, y: String) -> Bool {
    return Int(y) == x
}
```

These values are rounded to the nearest hundred, and are not adjusted for inflation.

I would be remiss not to credit [Jordan Rose], whose tabular format I have shamelessly copied.

[^1]: I started full-time in August 2016, so these numbers do not reflect a full year of employment.

## Why compensation transparency matters

- Pay equality
    - Pay Equity [bot] (UK data only)
- General malfeasance
    - Shutting down [survey]
    - Conspiracy to [suppress wages] of engineers in Silicon Valley

Companies routinely assure the public that they have pay equity, but there are plenty of reasons to
doubt these claims.
