# Mince Pies

Mince pies are a traditional Christmas treat in Britain. They are sweet miniature pies filled with
[mincemeat], which historically was a mixture of ground meat, alcohol or vinegar, [suet], spices,
and dried fruits. Contemporary mince pies, including these, generally omit the meat and substitute
animal suet for a version based on vegan saturated fats, like coconut oil.

It’s important not to confuse _mince,_ the British term for ground meat, with _mincemeat,_ the sweet
pie filling. This confusion has caused some [hilarious ground-beef-and-custard fails], but it also
makes some people afraid to try mince pies. Reassuing them that it’s a classic British culinary
delight may not always help.

I make my mince pies using _[pâte sucrée],_ which is a rich, sweet shortcrust pastry originating in
France. It’s possibly closer to a sugar cookie dough than to a classic American flaky pastry. Adding
a little bit of almond extract makes it just that much more Christmassy.

You can make your own mincemeat by soaking dried fruits and candied peel in brandy, but the longer
it steeps, the better. If you’re in a rush, in my experience, Robertson’s ([Amazon link]) makes some
of the best commercial mincemeat. One jar (411 g) is enough for twelve mince pies, which is perfect
for this recipe.

## Pâte sucrée

Makes enough pastry for 12–14 mince pies, with some left over.

### Ingredients
- 200 grams European-style unsalted butter (such as Kerrygold), room temperature
- 160 grams icing sugar, sieved
- pinch salt
- 400 grams flour, sieved
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- ½ teaspoon almond or vanilla extract

### Method
1. In stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and icing sugar until
   homogeneous.
2. Add flour and pinch of salt, beating together until just combined and scraping down the bowl as
   necessary.
3. Whisk together egg and almond extract, and slowly stream into bowl with mixer running. Stop when
   dough begins to clump together and do not overmix. It should be a bit crummy and there should be
   some streaks of unhyrdated flour still visible.
4. Dump onto an unfloured surface and [perform _fraisage_] to incorporate into a smooth dough. Roll
   into ball and flatten into disk.
5. Wrap with cling film and chill in fridge for at least 2 hours.

## Assembly

I highly recommend using the silicone non-stick 12-cup [muffin pan from USA Pan]. There’s no
need to grease or line the pan, and even if the mince pies overflow, they release with no issues.

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F, and place a baking tray in the oven to preheat.
2. Using of flour on a work surface and rolling pin, roll out the pastry to a thickness of 3 mm (⅛
   inch).
3. Use a 10 cm fluted cutter for the base, and a 6.5 cm ring cutter for the lid. Use a straw to cut
   (and slightly enlarge) a circle in the middle of the lid.
4. Press the base into the a muffin cup, and then fill with about a tablespoon of mincemeat. Resist
   the temptation to fill it all the way, since the filling will expand.
5. Brush water around the inside edge of the base, then place the lid onto the pie. Use your fingers
   to press the pastry together. Creating a tight seal is important for preventing leaks.
5. Bake for 20–25 minutes at 425°F, placing the muffin pan on the baking tray.
6. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then release pies onto a cooling rack to cool
   completely.
7. Dust with powdered sugar.
